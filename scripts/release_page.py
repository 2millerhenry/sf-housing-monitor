"""Build the text of a release page.

The release page is the download page -- the repository's website field points
at it -- so most people reading it have never seen the app. It leads with what
the app is and how to get it, and keeps the version's own changes and the
checksum folded away, because neither is what a first-time reader came for.

Written once here rather than by hand each release, so the page a stranger
lands on does not depend on which day it was published.

## Install

Takes about three minutes and never asks for a password.

### On a Mac

Apple Silicon (M1 or later), macOS 15.6 or newer. Intel Macs are not supported yet. Paste this into Terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/{REPO}/raw/HEAD/install.sh | bash
```

*19 MB · no password, no admin · your browser opens by itself when it is done*
{windows_install}
Once it opens, fill in **Your deal**, press save, and the first search starts.

## Opening it later

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** and bookmark it. On a Mac you can also type `homefinder` in a terminal; on Windows, use the **Open SF Home Finder** shortcut in the folder you unpacked. It runs on its own, so there is never anything to start.

## Free, private, and quiet

No account, no server, no subscription. It collects nothing about you and your search never leaves your laptop. It never emails a landlord or acts in your name — it reads what is already public and hands it to you.

Unpack it, then **Control-click** `2 Install SF Home Finder.command` and choose **Open**, twice. Control-click rather than double-click because the app is not code-signed; the command above has no such prompt, since macOS only marks what a browser downloaded.
