#
# Downloads the current release and runs the installer inside it -- the same one
# the ZIP contains, which checks every file against a checksum before using it.
#
# It never asks for your password, because nothing here needs an administrator;
# anything claiming otherwise is not this. It works in a temporary folder that is
# removed however it ends, and it touches nothing outside the app's own folder.
#
# There is no Gatekeeper prompt this way, which is a real difference rather than
# a trick: macOS marks what a *browser* downloads, and curl is not a browser. The
# bytes are identical to the ZIP either way.
