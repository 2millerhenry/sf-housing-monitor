"""Whether a newer release exists. Nothing about who is asking.

This app collects nothing and its searches never leave the machine, which is
most of why anybody should trust it. Asking a public page whether a newer
version exists is the one outbound request it makes on its own behalf, so it is
worth being exact about what that costs: a GET to the GitHub releases API, with
no query, no body, no identifier, and not even the installed version -- the
comparison happens here, after the answer comes back. GitHub learns that some
IP address read a public page, which is what it learns when anybody opens the
releases page in a browser. ``SF_HOUSING_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`` turns it off
entirely and everything downstream then behaves as though no answer exists.

The reason it exists at all: there is no other way to fix anything. Nobody
reports a crash here, because nothing is reported anywhere. Without this, a bug
shipped is a bug that stays on every machine that has it, and the only people
who would ever learn of a fix are the ones who happen to revisit a web page.

Nothing here ever runs while a page is rendering. A scheduled job refreshes the
stored answer, and everything that displays it reads what was stored, so a slow
or unreachable GitHub can never hold up the dashboard.
