"""Whether a newer release exists, and what is allowed to be said about it.

This is the only outbound request the app makes for its own sake, on an app
whose whole claim is that it collects nothing, so what it may do is narrow: ask
a public page, store the answer, never send anything about anybody, and stop
entirely when told to. It is also the only route by which a bug already on
somebody's machine can ever be fixed, since nothing here reports anything and
nobody would otherwise learn that a fix exists.

The failure this is built to survive is silence. GitHub being unreachable, rate
limited, slow, or answering with a login page are all ordinary, and none of
them may reach a person or hold up a page.
