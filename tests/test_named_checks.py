"""A listing was labelled instead of the unknown being named.

"Needs verification" told a renter that something about a home was unresolved
but never what, so the badge could not be acted on. Worse, the one sentence the
row did show came from a different selection than the constraints that actually
held the listing back: a $1,845-per-week sublet said only "needs verification",
its Check column talked about the sublet term, and the fact that the amount
might not be a monthly rent at all appeared nowhere on the page.

Every constraint now carries the short name of what is unresolved as well as
the sentence. The tests here are mostly about the two ways naming can go wrong:
naming the wrong one, and naming none because a new constraint was added
without a name.
