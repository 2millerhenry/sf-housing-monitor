"""One check by hand a day, and no limit on the ones the clock asks for.

Every source is somebody else's site read by a program, and the ones that mind
say so by blocking. Per-source floors already space single reads apart, but the
button had no limit at all: held down while somebody waited for results, it
could spend an account's welcome in an afternoon.

The scheduled checks, the nightly sweep and the catch-ups are bounded by their
own cron and are the whole point of the app, so they are never refused -- an
earlier version of this counted them against the same allowance, and the effect
was that the button stopped working on the nights the sweep ran. These pin the
limit to the scans a person actually asks for.
