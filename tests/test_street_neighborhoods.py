"""The city housing portal states an address but never a neighbourhood.

Area carries the most weight in the score, so a portal listing with no
neighbourhood could not be ranked against a renter's actual preferences: it
scored a neutral 0.5 and told them "neighbourhood is not stated". Nine out of
ten now resolve.

Two properties matter more than coverage, and most of these tests are about
them. The answer must never be a guess -- a block the city's own data splits
between two neighbourhoods resolves to nothing -- and it must be identical from
one scan to the next, so a home does not move between areas while someone is
deciding about it.
