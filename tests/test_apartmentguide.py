"""ApartmentGuide: a whole building read from one page, with no detail fetch.

The fixtures are real captured records, trimmed. Four San Francisco buildings
chosen for the behaviours that are easy to get wrong -- a building with homes
free today that *also* publishes a future date, a building letting two sizes, a
building with nothing free and two future dates -- plus one real Oakland record,
so the locality guard is proved against a page that genuinely contains one
rather than against a page that never could.

``apartmentguide_padded.html`` is the same page with one San Francisco building
named in ``expandedSearchIds``. No San Francisco query was observed to pad, so
that id is set deliberately: ApartmentGuide ships Rent.com's payload and
Rent.com pads, and the guard has to hold the day it starts.
